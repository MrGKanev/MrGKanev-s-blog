I'm a self-employed web designer, developer, geek and open-source enthusiast. I love building things
that make developers more productive and happier.

My past gig was at [Mi9Retail](https://mi9retail.com/e-commerce/) where I worked on E-commerce websites and blogs used by millions of users.

On this page, you will find the projects I've worked on,
as well as some of my GitHub repos, blog posts, and some of the talks
I've given over the years.
